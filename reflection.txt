Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
This semester I saw the power of functions while wokring through the Periodic Table assignment we had working with dictionaries. The functions there were so cool, it was crazy 
to me that with just a few lines of code I could calculate the atomic mass of whatever combination of elements I wanted to. It was very tricky to figure out, but in the end I 
did. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
The value of test funtions is in their usefulness to test a variety of different situations, and reveal if there are any errors. Writing test helps to refine
the final product of whatever project is being worked on, and creates an overall better product. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
Whenever I am troubleshooting and fixing a program that has a problem, I always check for an error code/message first. If there is one, I do my best to understand what the error 
is, and if needed I turn to Google for greater undersanding. Then once I understand the issue I think of possible solutions. When I come up with solutions I test those, and repeat
that this process over and over until the problem is fixed. I could probably improve this process by relying more on others, and asking for help.
