CSE-111 Repository
This repository is from the second programming class that I took, still using Python. In this class we learned how to write functions and create more complex programs, and I had a lot of fun learning new things here. Some of these programs required me to spend some sleepless nights working on them, which is kind of silly in hindsight since they're still relatively simple, but they were great sources of learning and growth for me.
